The best way to learn what DeBaCl does and how to use it is to work through the Jupyter notebooks in this folder. They should render correctly on GitHub, and they can be downloaded if you'd like to run the code locally.

1. [Getting started](getting_started.ipynb)
2. [What is a level set tree?](what_are_level_set_trees.ipynb)
3. [Level set tree quality and choosing the bandwidth](in progress)

Suggestions for other notebooks are very welcome, (as are bug reports for existing notebooks).
